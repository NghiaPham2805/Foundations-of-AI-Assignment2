Author: Pham Trung Nghia - s4028630
Here are my Jupyter notebook, figures and scripts for assignment 2 of FoAI
There are a lot of figures I did not include in the report as well as a lot of block of code and scripts to figure out how the model works, how to generate diagram and boxplots, what does RMSE and R^2 means, etc. Thanks for checking out.
